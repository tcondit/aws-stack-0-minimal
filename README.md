# aws-stack-0-minimal
Minimal AWS stack. Created with Terraform, no application provisioning.

This is something like an AWS "hello, world" with Terraform. It's intentionally minimal, with annotations.

## Prerequisites

* An AWS account
* An AWS key pair (can be generated thru the AWS console or at the command line)
* Terraform
* An SSH client
